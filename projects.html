            <div>
              This is my favorite project as it was requested and is being used
              by the Syracuse <span class="highlight">Fire Department</span>.
              FIT stands for Fire Incident Tracker and it used by the chief at
              the site of fire to manage teams, tasks, and time as the scene
              develops. A mobile cross platform for iPads and tablets, The FIT
              app is <span class="highlight">real world use</span> application,
              densely packed with components that can track time, track tasks,
              and <span class="highlight">drag-and-drop</span> items.This was a
              <span class="highlight">team project</span> with one other
              student, and our first time using react and react native.

            <h2>Great Salts</h2>
            <div>
              A mock company based out of Utah, Great Salts sells different
              types of... great salts from around the world including the Great
              Salt Lake in Utah. This website is connected to a
              <span class="highlight">database</span> using PHP and MySQL. There
              is also <span class="highlight">user authentication</span> that
              runs on sessions, allowing admins to edit the product and customer
              inventories straight form the website, and allows customers to
              purchase product from a paginated list of items. When a new
              customer registers, a
              <span class="highlight">verification email</span> is sent to the
              user.

              This <span class="highlight">mobile</span> app is a recreation of
              Uber, allowing the user to input a pickup and drop-off location.
              Directions, mapping, travel time, and travel distance are
              calculated and shown using <span class="highlight">Google Api's</span>. Different prices options
              are shown for different types of vehicles. Redux is used to give
              global access throughout different pages and components.

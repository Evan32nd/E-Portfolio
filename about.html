          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I started my software development journey in March of 2022, learning
            to code online. After creating small javascript projects, I realised
            that I would love to make this my career. I enrolled in the software
            development program at the Davis Applied Technical College in
            Kaysville, Utah in April and completed the course by December.

            As coders I think we all find creating projects hands on very
            satisfying, this is what immediately hooked me. The process of
            problem solving and the frustration that comes with working through
            errors is what makes coding so rewarding. There isn't much better
            than making your program run, after getting stuck and thinking it
            was outside of your capabilities. Learning is very valuable and fun
            to me, and I see software development as an endless supply.
